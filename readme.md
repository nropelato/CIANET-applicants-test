# Cianet Labs juniors test  
  
This is a repository to evaluate skills of the developers who want's to join our team.  
  
All is made in Node.js and javascript.  
  
### Which tools you have to use to run this application  
  
* Node.js >= v.10.15.3  
* npm >= 6.4.1  
* An IDE or text editor of your preference  
  
### How to use this application  
  
Just clone this repo, go into the project root and run npm install.  
This will install all dependencies of this project.  
  
Then you need to solve the challenges in the src folder.  
  
Each challenge has it's documentation and how to run it.  
  
When the challenge is solved, the console log of the test will log for you.  
  
### Testing guide  
  
#### Average sum  
  
This is a very simple test. Just to warm up and learn how to work with this tool.  
  
Just open the src/average.js and put you code solution inside the function.  
The function must return the average of the sum of the two parameters.

The function must return a number (float/integer)

When you finished the job, just run 'npm run avg'  
  
If everything is ok, the result will be:

#### Fibonacci sequence 

This is another basic test.
Just open the src/fibonacci.js and put you code solution inside the function.  
The function function should return the first n Fibonacci numbers in an array.

The function must return an array ([0,1,1])

When you finished the job, just run 'npm run fibonnaci'  

If everything is ok, the result will be:

####  Check if is Palindrome

This is a fun test.
Just open the src/palindrome.js and put you code solution inside the function.  
The function function should return if a given text is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., _madam_ or _nurses run_.

The function must return a boolean.

When you finished the job, just run 'npm run palindrome'  

If everything is ok, the result will be:

####  Check if is Pangram

A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma, "every letter")  is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. The best known English pangram is:  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  
The alphabet used consists of ASCII letters a to z, inclusive, and is case insensitive.  
Input will not contain non-ASCII symbols.
Just open the src/pangram.js and put you code solution inside the function.  
The function function should return if a given sentence is a pangram.

The function must return a boolean.

When you finished the job, just run 'npm run pangram'  

If everything is ok, the result will be:

## What I have to do with my code.

Create a new github repo and push your test to this new repo.

Attention to .gitignore. Use this to avoid push node_modules and IDE/Editor files.
